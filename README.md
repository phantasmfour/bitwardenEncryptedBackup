# bitwardenEncryptedBackup
Attempt at pulling backups without fully authenticating

You can authenticated to bitwarden using the API but not fully unlock your vault with your master password.

During this time though you are able to pull all your credentials in encrypted format. 

All you need to do is figure out how clients would decrypt this data with the master password.

This seems a little bit harder than I think even though bitwarden is open source.

If you can find it you can make a cool back script that does not require interaction and you master password to automate.
